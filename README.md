# Group19_Big_data_trendplace-Project

Members: Arkan Chatterjee, Havish Gutta, Songhan Lei, Jiatong Li, Anurag Mishra

Abstract: 
Apache Zeppelin is a Web-based multi purpose notebook that enables data-driven,
interactive data analytics and collaborative documents with popular programming languages such as SQL, Scala, Python, R and more. Our team will focus on the multi-purpose benefits of Zeppelin notebook, which include data ingestion, data discovery, data pipelines and data visualization & collaboration. This key feature could facilitate the big data analytics process by using a sample data pipeline. 

Scenario: 
We will create a Zeppelin notebook data pipeline from Kaggle as our demo to describe how Zeppelin works through different languages, such as Apache Spark, Python, R and SQL. Firstly, we will use Zeppelinâ€™s built-in functions to do some basic data exploration and data visualization to extract insights. This is a real-time streaming process, which is very convenient for data science professionals to manipulate a large volume of data. Finally, our team members will collaborate with each other on the same notebook to optimize our analysis because Zeppelin will broadcast any changes in real time, just like the collaboration in Google docs.     


Dataset: FIFA 21 complete player dataset
This dataset is provided by FIFA which is a sports governance organization with members all over around the world. The information in this dataset includes the player's name, age, date of birth, salary, abilities value (including shooting, passing, dribbling score), etc. We will load this dataset into Amazon S3, do some basic data preparation and then perform data analysis and build a dashboard with graphs through Apache Zeppelin.
